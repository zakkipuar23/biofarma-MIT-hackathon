# Biofarma x MIT Hackathon
I joined hackathon which was held by Biofarma (one of the largest Pharmaceutical company in Indonesia) and MIT Hacking Medicine. I applied as individual and became 200 shortlisted participants from more than 1000 registrants. 

Our team initially want to create mobile app design that provides end-to-end solution in health care, starting from health tracking to emergency handling. But, based on feedback from mentor and workshop, we changed it, down to single focus idea, which is feature improvement in Mediverse (mobile apps developed by Biofarma that already provides end-to-end solution). We thought that if we proposed new mobile apps, it would only become Mediverse competitor, and user could be more confuse like "which app should we use??"
